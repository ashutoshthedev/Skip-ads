Too many and long unskippanle ads in your YouTube?
Here is simple python code which can be used to skip any ad on YouTube.

I used python as programming language so don't worry ðŸ˜‰

Here are the all module I used to code this program:
cv2: ```pip install opencv-python```
time: ```Comes pre-installed with Python```
pyautogui: ```pip install PyAutoGUI```
numpy: ```Comes pre-installed with Python```

If you found any problem, you can email me.
Happy watching :)
